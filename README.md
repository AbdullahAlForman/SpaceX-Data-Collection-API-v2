## Project Overview

This project aims to provide a comprehensive tool for collecting and analyzing data from SpaceX's public API. The Jupyter notebook included in this repository demonstrates how to fetch data on SpaceX launches, process it, and perform basic analysis.

## Features

- Fetch data from the SpaceX API
- Process and clean the collected data
- Perform basic analysis on the launch data
- Visualize the results using various plotting libraries

## Installation

To get started with this project, you'll need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow the steps below to set up the project environment:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spacex-data-collection-api-v2.git
   cd spacex-data-collection-api-v2
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Open the Jupyter notebook to explore the data collection and analysis process. You can start the Jupyter notebook server by running:
```sh
jupyter notebook
```

Then, open the `spacex-data-collection-api-v2.ipynb` file in your browser and follow the steps outlined in the notebook.

## Data Collection

The notebook demonstrates how to use the SpaceX API to fetch data on their launches. The collected data includes details such as launch dates, rocket types, payload information, and launch outcomes.

## Analysis

Once the data is collected, the notebook provides examples of how to clean and process the data. It also includes basic analysis such as calculating success rates, identifying trends over time, and visualizing the data using plots.
